### A quote I like 😎:
##### Philippians 4:13
"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." 💪

### A food I don't like 👎:
I would eat almost any food, but definitely not Octopus... 🤮

### Travel recommendation ✈:
##### Landmark Beach. 
Somewhere in Lagos Nigeria, where I can recommend visiting would be Landmark Beach. You can choose from clubbing to swimming, lounging, or if you're looking for something more active, you can play golf and there are football pitches, basketball and volleyball courts available, in addition to an amusement park and games for kids. 🏊‍♀️ 🤸

### A useful German word 📝:
##### Entschuldigung
It's definitely have to be one of the most used words in German. From taking an excuse to asking questions or apologizing, it's a most-know word in German for me.
